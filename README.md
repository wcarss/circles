# what causes such beauty

Marvin Minsky found that a fairly simple transformation that approximates circular motion:

```js
x = x â€“ (y >> 4)
y = y + (x >> 4)
```

when split across 3 points, causing each of their motions to tug on the others:

```js
ya = ya + ((xa + xb) >> sh0);
xa = xa - ((ya - yb) >> sh1);
yb = yb + ((xb - xc) >> sh2);
xb = xb - ((yb - yc) >> sh3);
yc = yc + ((xc - xa) >> sh4);
xc = xc - ((yc - ya) >> sh5);
```

results in wild spirals and swooping arcs, rather than simple circles. The shN variables above are numbers from 0-8, and different values for those produce interestingly different results in the plotted points.

By then wrapping all of the resulting coordinates into a specific range, they overlap and interact with each other repeatedly, forming a nice base for some generative art. And then you put in nice colours, some randomness for sizes and shapes, and set the whole thing slowly twirling!
